# python-SL4a
UK traffic alert on Android

This is a python script that runs on top of SL4A on android smartphones. It pulls public data in realtime of UK traffic information and then filter them based your current location, so it will only report traffic, for example, within 20 miles radius of your current location. This is very handy when you're on the road as this is configurable as alert rather than an interactive apps.

The only requirement here is to install SL4A on your android smartphone and execute this script.
